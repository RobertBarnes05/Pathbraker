# Pathbraker
Pathbreaker is a texted based maze adventure built fully in python, a call back to 1980's. Navigation through the maze is made with typed commands, 'North', 'East', 'South' and 'West'. When you reach a dead end you encounter a monster which will then ask you a riddle, if you get it right you are trasported to your last correct location. If you get it wrong three times its GAME OVER.
